*WASP LANG (ASSEMBLY IMITATION) CALCULATOR*

Made this for University assignment!

16 bit calculator which uses dynamic memory allocation to read, write and operate on numbers of any size (full-memeory-size/6 > max num > 16bit).
Spend a lot of time on this and it was underappreciated ): Still cool if you have the capacity to understand it unlike some...
